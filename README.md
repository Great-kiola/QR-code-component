Project Title: QR-code card component

This is a simple, and easy to create card component that was hosted by frontend mentor. it has helped me to learn more about styling div cards and how to postion div cards. This is a fun project and i would be doing more in the near future

## Features
Here are some of the notable features of the component

- It contains a simple image of a qr code that links to the front-end mentor page.
- It also contains a paragraph and an heading text which were the easiest to style.
- The card is responsive in all size of both mobile and desktop.

- it also contains a simple footer like text, that links to my Github page and frontend mentor website.
## Installation

Requires no installation,
- Just run the program in github pages
## Problems
It was a bit hard to get the div to be centered in the page and after using my googling skills i was able to get it to the center.

fixing the image was a bit of an hassle also, but i managed to get it done and fix all issues i had.
